## 🚀 Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Label Encoding / Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.
6. *(Optional)* Export trained model using `joblib` or `pickle`

## 📈 Model Performance

Multiple models were trained and evaluated. Logistic Regression showed promising accuracy and interpretability. Metrics used:
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall
- Confusion Matrix
